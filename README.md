The project will consists of programming a drone for autonomous flight using GPS. The drone will use GPS coordinates to perform the trajectory in the shape of a square. The drone I have selected is the PlutoX drone and the GPS I will use is the SparkFun GPS Breakout - XA1110 board. One of the issues I have immediately encountered is the flight controller uses C++ as it programming language while the GPS does not have C++ support. The solution is to use a Arduino Uno board as an intermediate between the flight controller and the GPS board. I will connect the GPS board to the Arduino Uno utilizing I2C protocol and the flight controller will connect to the Arduino board using the UART protocol. This project will be modified whenever it becomes needed.
